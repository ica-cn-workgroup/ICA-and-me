# 1. Introduction
Instrumentation, control and automation (ICA) is a hidden
technology. It is not noticed as long as it works. Still it is
becoming ubiquitous in most water systems. ICA was recognized
already in the early 1970s by IWA (International Water
Association) and its predecessors IAWPRC (International
Association on Water Pollution Research and Control) and
IAWQ (International Association on Water Quality) as an
important technology to improve operation in both water and
wastewater operations and to satisfy both quality of the
effluent and efficiency of the operation. Two key technicaldriving
forces made this possible: the development of process
computers and of on-line instrumentation. Today ICA is
certainly much more established and almost every water and
wastewater treatment plant is supplied with a computer
control system.

ICA includes all the information that is generated and used
in a system. With today’s computer technology and instrumentation
we take it for granted to get a lot of data. However,
data rich is not the same as information rich. Data has to be
interpreted: signal patterns must be analyzed and various
signals can be combined and compared to expected behaviour.
This can form the basis for some action. ICA is not one
large black box in a control room without any people. The
ideal ICA system contains:
* A quality team of people who feel a deep sense of ownership
of the system and who are committed to the continuous
improvement ethics;
* An instrumentation system that gathers adequate process
variable information;
* A monitoring system to gather data, process and display
the data, detect and isolate measurement faults or
process abnormal situations, assist in diagnosis and
advice, and finally simulate the consequences of operational
adjustments. Proper data acquisition and reporting
is crucial;
* A control system to meet the goals of the operation. This is
implemented both locally within each unit process and as
co-ordination of the various unit processes within the
plant.

The need for ICA can be motivated in many different ways.
“The effluent water looks fine and satisfies the regulator”. But
how good is it? Will it meet the regulations and the scrutiny of
tomorrow? Can we trim the operating costs? Will the plant
handle the inevitable load increases? How big a load will it
take before more tank volume is needed? Effluent standards
will get tighter. Already the regulations in some countries
must be met on the basis of spot checks, not monthly averages.
Failure to comply will cost dearly. Recurrent budgets are
getting tighter and will get even tighter.

Both drinking water and wastewater systems need control,
not only to guarantee the quality of the water. Efficiency and
energy costs are becoming increasingly important with rising
energy prices. The water and energy interdependence is more
and more recognized. Water lost by leakages in a water
distribution system is an energy loss. All of this motivates
more on-line monitoring and control.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes to the global greenhouse
effect by about 6%. The N2O is around 300 times more efficient
to absorb heat compared to CO2. The atmosphere contains
only a small amount of the gas, but it will stay there for about
150 years. Since N2O can be produced in nitrification and
denitrification processes it is of great interest to control the
GHG emission in activated sludge operations. Recent studies
have shown that dynamic conditions can cause increased N2O
emission (Kampschreur et al., 2008).

All processes can be controlled to perform better. It is the
process knowledge, the sensor technology and the way the
plants have been designed and built that may limit what can
be achieved today. We also know that wastewater processes
have some unique features compared to other process
industries: the flow rates, the disturbances, the small
concentrations, the organisms, the separation, and the fact
that all the “raw material” has to be accepted and treated. The
critical issues are the attitudes and incentives. Of course
the attitudes often depend on the incentives. Today we have
the incentives to invest in ICA and we can use many of the
results from other process industries that introduced ICA
earlier.

The motivation for all control is the presence of disturbances.
The load to a wastewater treatment plant is hardly
ever constant. The flow rate, the concentrations and the
composition of the influent wastewater are changing all the
time. In many cases there is an order of magnitude difference
between the lowest and the highest load during the day. Many
disturbances are created internally, within the plant, as
a result of the operation. Several recycle flows can cause
major operational problems unless they are carefully
controlled, such as the return sludge flow rate, nitrate recirculation,
digester supernatants, or backwash filter flows. With
all these disturbances it is impossible to operate any plant
with constant settings of pumps, compressors, valves and
other actuators.

Drinking water systems are also subject to disturbances.
The systems are driven by the customer demands and the
water production has to track the consumer behaviour. The
plant can usually only level the daily consumption patterns. In
a distribution system the pressure has to be controlled. With
a variable pressure control energy can be saved and the
occurrence of leakages can become less frequent.
Disturbances caused by leakages or water quality disturbances
have to be detected and located, and actions have to be
taken.

We often describe control and automation in three major
levels:
* Keep the plant running;
* Satisfy the effluent requirements;
* Maximize the efficiency.

On the primary level of plant operation, the equipment, we
nowadays take control for granted. Levels, flow rates, pressures
and temperatures are mostly controlled automatically
via pumps, compressors and valves. These controls will keep
the plant running. At this level there are standardized control
loops that are common in any process industry. Automation
vendors usually have sufficient knowledge to install successful
operation to keep the plant running.

On the next level there are many concentration control
loops. In an activated sludge plant automatic control of dissolved
oxygen (DO), sludge age, return sludge and other
concentrations are proven methodologies. In most plants this
level of control is successful. It helps to maintain the effluent
quality; it allows unmanned operation during nights and
weekends and saves energy and other operational costs.

However, already at this second level there are many control
systems that fail. The reason is not that the control is difficult
or that the sensors are not sufficiently robust. The simple
reason is that many implementers do not have sufficient
knowledge of the process dynamics or do not efficiently
communicate their knowledge to colleagues. Sensors are
located at wrong positions, data analysis is not adequate,
sampling frequencies are often unrealistic (mostly too fast), or
the controller settings are not adequate.

On-line nutrient sensors are becoming common and
affordable. This makes it possible to control the dissolved
oxygen with a variable setpoint, depending on the ammonia
removal. The dosage of chemicals can be based on on-line
phosphate measurements and the recirculation of the
nitrate rich water in pre-denitrification plants can be based on
nitrate measurements in the anoxic reactor. Most often the
payback time for the more costly instruments is amazingly
short. Energy can be saved and the dosage of chemicals can be
minimized. Other sensors, like pH and gas flow rate, make it
possible to run an anaerobic digester with higher throughput
while still keeping the operation safe.

To maximize the efficiency also means that we can no
longer operate each unit process in isolation. Instead a plantwide
or a system-wide approach is in demand. The sludge
production in the liquid train of an activated sludge system has
to be related to the desired sludge level in the anaerobic
digestion to produce biogas. The operation of the sewer has to
relate to the capacity of the wastewater treatment system. The
electrical energyconsumption in the plant has to be minimized
and this requires a plant-wide perspective. A wastewater
treatment plant can serve as a net energy producer using the
energy from biogas and effluent heat content. It is obvious that
wastewater treatment plant operation is complex. What
makes it increasingly complex is the mentioned requirements
of efficient operation all around the clock. The plant has to
consistently meet disturbances, making maximum use of
available volumes, and all the time satisfy the requirement of
the effluent quality. To give a consistent and clear order to
control goals is a truly multi-criteria decision problem and is
considered to be the overall challenge of ICA.

Also for a drinking water plant the control has to be plantwide
so that high efficiency is obtained. All water that is
produced has to meet the quality criteria. There is a tight
coupling between the unit processes which forces the control
to take the couplings into consideration.
I have to admit that I accepted the invitation to write about
“ICA and me” with mixed feelings. On one hand I was excited
to describe my own personal journey to understand and
control urban water and wastewater systems and to describe
my experiences. On the other hand I was fearful: to include
“me” in the title is pretentious. So many gifted researchers
and other professionals have made great impact on the ICA
development. How can I possibly add anything of interest and
be fair to all significant contributions? Just from the ten ICA
conferences arranged by IWA around 800 papers have been
published. This article is a record of a personal journey that
started in 1972 and is still going on. It is not a conventional
state-of-the-art paper on ICA. Rather it reflects personal
discoveries, disappointments, encouraging developments and
personal hopes. Many applications of ICA have not been
described satisfactorily and have been overlooked due to the
subjective perspective. A more detailed description of the ICA
area is found in the textbook Olsson and Newell (1999) and in
the state-of-the-art report Olsson et al. (2005).
I will narrate the early years of ICA from my own experiences.
Most of them are from the wastewater treatment areas
but also water distribution problems, in particular leakage
detection and localisation. The ICA conferences organized by
IWA and its predecessors give quite a good reflection of the
progress in ICA over the years, Sec. 2-3. Overviews of sensors
and actuators (Sec. 4), modelling for control (Sec. 5), data
analysis and monitoring (Sec. 6) are presented. Leakage
detection in water distribution is another application of
monitoring, described in Sec. 7. Various unit process control
aspects in wastewater treatment are reviewed in Sec. 8 and
ways to test monitoring and control systems via benchmarking
are discussed in Sec. 9. Controlling drinking water
systems is briefly described in Sec. 10, and in Sec. 11 the
concepts of system-wide or plant-wide control are outlined.
Over the years I have experienced the importance of driving
forces and incentives, Sec. 12. Maybe most important, I have
met some truly dedicated people that became role models,
Sec. 13. So, what is the future? I will speculate in Sec. 14.
